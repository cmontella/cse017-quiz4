# CSE 017 - Quiz 4

Answer the following questions, min. 1 commit per question:

## Question 1

We looked at a number of algorithms for shorting lists of items. Some of them were O(n^2) in average case computational time complexity (selection, insertion, bubble). Some were O(nlogn) (merge, quick, heap). Obviously we'd like all sorting algorithms to run as fast as possible, but what are some benefits of the algoirthms that run in O(n^2) time and why would we ever want to use those over O(nlogn) algorithms?

## Question 2

What does it mean for a sorting algorithm to be "stable"?

## Question 3

What does it mean for a sorting algorithm to be "online"?

## Question 4 

What does it mean for a sorting algorithm to be "in place"?
